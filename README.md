# Necromancer
A discord bot that allows you to play the classic forum board game of "Thread Necromancy"

## NOTICE
As Discord.py is no longer maintained, I will archive this repository. The bot works fine as-is, to my knowledge. Should there be any bugs or errors, I will fix them in the next iteration of The Necromancer, should there be a next iteration.

## Setup
1. Go and [download python](https://python.org), if you haven't already. Make sure you're using Python 3.7 and up  
2. Clone this repository, and change directory into the folder
```
git clone https://github.com/glitch-in-the-herring/necromancer.git
cd necromancer
```  
3. Using `pip`, install the requirements:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Create a Discord application by heading over [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications), if you haven't already  
5. Run `python3 main.py` to set the bot up for the first time
