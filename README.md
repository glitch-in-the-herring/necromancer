# Necromancer
A discord bot that allows you to play the classic forum board game of "Thread Necromancy"

## NOTICE (Mar 16, 2022)
As discord.py has continued development, the current plan right now is to get the codebase updated. However, I am busy with college and that will probably be delayed for a few months.

## Setup
1. Go and [download python](https://python.org), if you haven't already. Make sure you're using Python 3.7 and up  
2. Clone this repository, and change directory into the folder
```
git clone https://github.com/glitch-in-the-herring/necromancer.git
cd necromancer
```  
3. Using `pip`, install the requirements:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Create a Discord application by heading over [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications), if you haven't already  
5. Run `python3 main.py` to set the bot up for the first time
